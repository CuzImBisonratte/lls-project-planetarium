# Planetarium

This planetary is a web-page that has been a school project in my 11th year.

It is now archived as it is no longer actively developed, as the project is finished.

## Planetary Images
The images of the planets used are not provided through this git repo.  
Here you have links to the planetary images I used.

If an image downloaded is not square, the image needs to be centered to the planet and be cropped to be square.
